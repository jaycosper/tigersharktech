# Wells Gardner K7000

## Basic Chassis Testing

### 19” K7000
1. Check fuse
1. Check resistors in Power Section
    1. R103 2.7Ω
        1. Maybe 2.8Ω in circuit
    1. Rectifier Diodes can be checked with R104 resistance
        1. R104 15Ω
        1. If reads GOOD, then likely diodes are OK
        1. Or measure diode with Diode check D19-D24, negative lead on stripe
    1. R101 6.4kΩ
        1. 4.5-6kΩ in circuit
    1. R89 3.9kΩ
    1. R96 1.8kΩ
        1. may not be installed on all chassis
    1. R88 1.8kΩ
    1. R97 270Ω
1. C38 Width Capacitor
    1. verify that it is not shorted
1. Q11 High Output Transistor (HOT)
    1. 0.46V drop between legs
    1. Negative lead on collector
1. C36 Critical Safety Capacitor
    1. Two styles:
        1. four lead device
        1. Two discrete caps
    1. Read diagonally from negative bottom two pins to top two pins
        1. Top is defined as pins closer to the board edge
        1. In diode mode, the measurement should be the same as the HOT
1. IC4 Voltage Regulator STR3123
    1. Two styles: TALL or FAT
    1. Measure in diode mode
    1. Tall
        1.  Negative lead on pin 3
        1. Positive lead on pin 4
        1. 0.16V
    1. FAT
        1. Negative lead on pin 1
        1. Positive lead on pin 4
        1. 0.13-0.15V
1. R301 197Ω B+ Resistor
    1. Same as checking IC4
